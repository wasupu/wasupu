## Roadmap

### Phase 0: Tanken suru

The initial phase of wasupu is learn and explore the techniques and technologies needed to create the robots.

We think that one of the core technologies to design and create autonomous robots is deep reinforcement learning, the following projects are experiments to learn this technique:

### Phase 1: Heya

Test robots in a plain, square, walled world. Like a room. For more information visit the project [heya](https://github.com/wasupu/heya)

### Phase 2: Ie
Test robots in a plain, any geometric, wallet world. Like a house.

One autonomous robot in a plain, any geometric, wallet world.
