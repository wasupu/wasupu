# Wasupu

The target of the project is explore Europa the satellite of Jupiter using microrobots, many, small, low cost, autonomous robots.

## The project name

Wasupu (sumo) from the Japanese word for "wasp" (ワスプ)

## Roadmap

### Phase 0: Tanken suru

The initial phase of wasupu is learn and explore the techniques and technologies needed to create the robots.

#### Deep reinforcement learning

We think that one of the core technologies to design and create autonomous robots is deep reinforcement learning, the following projects are experiments to learn this technique:

* https://github.com/wasupu/cart-pole
* https://github.com/wasupu/frozen-lake

#### Lego mindstorms

* https://github.com/wasupu/drag-racer

### Phase 1: Heya

The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.
